        <div class="text">New York City proper does not have a light rail. However, the neighboring Husdon County has a light rail that serves Jersey City, Hoboken, and North Bergen. Established in April 2000, it is connected in various stations with the PATH train that connects the region to New York. Despite being a fairly-new system, it sees some success as according to the New Jersey Transit, about 50,000 commuters depend on it daily. In addition, it is easy to maintain, as it is a weekly rail that does not run 24/7. It is also localized to a relatively small area (well, compared to NYC); when I went to Jersey City, it took me only an hour to walk from Exchange Place to Hoboken.

        <div class="text">In terms of the city itself, there have been proposals to build a light-rail in a certain area, the most successful being that of the Brooklyn–Queens Connector, abbreviated the BQX. Current plans are to run from Astoria to Red Hook, with stops at Long Island City, Williamsburg, and Downtown Brooklyn. In addition, the BQX boasts accessibility, with streetcars (not LRVs) and boarding areas that match the height for smooth entry and exiting. The presence of these streetcars will provide "traffic calming," per their website, www.brooklynqueensconnector.nyc.

        </div>

        <div class="text">This seems very familiar; because it is. The MBTA does most of what the BQX advertises well. On paper, the BQX seems to be a fine successor to the various streetcars that have run through the city in ages past. In fact, it has received the blessing of Mayor Bill de Blasio, and it would run through up-and-coming neighborhoods as well as major train stations like Jay Street - MetroTech and Vernon Boulevard.
        </div>

        <div class="img"><img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimgs.6sqft.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F08%2F30120325%2Fbqx-street-car-rendering.jpg&f=1&nofb=1"></div>


        <div class="text">There are many lessons to be applied from the MBTA, especially the Green Line. Recognizing the ability for automobiles and light rail to co-exist to a degree has led to the creation of park-and-rides, as well as access from Milton to Boston. In addition, being mindful of accessibility and ADA compliancy has become a staple in American transportation innovation lately. The use of streetcars, especially those with low-floor occupancy, has led to greater mobility among those with disabilities. As demonstrated with the Mattapan trolley and the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail, streetcars are an optimal, cost-efficient way to transport outer-city residents, if not to the city itself, to major transit hubs.

        <div class="text">However, in order to fully make New York like Boston, a major overhaul of the city's infrastructure and way of thinking may be needed. First of all, of the MTA's 472 stations, only 24% are ADA accessible, according to Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer's website. Of that 24%, most are accessible via elevator, which sometimes do not even work. Some stations are accessible in only one direction; for example, the 1 train, an IRT Seventh Avenue Line, has Dyckman Street, which is only accesible going downtown. According to Valeria Ricciulli of Curbed New York, the MTA plans to make at least 70 stations ADA compliant. However, there is little hope in the city, as the MTA cannot even fix their own signal problems.

        <div class="text">In terms of dedicated lanes, there have been attempts with the Select Bus Service to have specifically-marked lanes for buses to run through, particularly on 34th Street and 14th Street, where the latter has elevated platforms and essentially the whole avenue to it. Still, as one who frequents the M34 SBS, sometimes it is much easier to walk. Infrequent bus times and slow traffic make it near impossible to take the bus. New York has tried many times to address congestion in the city; its most recent effort with congestion pricing is facing massive backlash from New Jersey lawmakers, who think the plan is "not fair". Josh Gottenheimer states that New Jerseyans "shouldn't be responsible for bailing out the MTA for their mismanagement" and that New York is attempting to "mooching off Jersey once again to solve their own problems". Note that there are many methods to get into New York, not just by the many bridges and tunnels, but by the PATH train, the New Jersey Transit (train and buses), as well as the Amtrak and Metro-North under certain occasions. Below is a proposed zone pricing boundary through which the city can charge congestion pricing.

        <div class="text">Despite the efforts being made to make New York more accessible and accomodating to other methods of transport, there is still much that needs to be done. A suggestion would be avenues like Queens Boulevard and Eastern Parkway, two streets that serve a number of people and do not have as much traffic as other neighborhoods. Already, efforts have been made to instill traffic calming, such as dedicated lanes for pedestrians and reducing space for cars. Further implementation in other boulevards like Myrtle Avenue and Flatbush Avenue would make for at least some space to implement light rail where subways do not already cover the area.
        </div>

        <div class="text">In addition, a significant chunk of New York is not covered by the subway, as seen in this map:
        </div>

        <div class="img"><img src="http://maponline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Official_New_York_City_Subway_Map_vc.jpg"></div>

        <div class="text">Of note are the Flushing area, Middle Village, and East New York. Without a significant subway presence, a light-rail or bus rapid transit can be created to facilitate access to major subway hubs. In particular, Flushing is a very vibrant community, though it is not easily walkable. Many of the area's top spots require a bus to get there, and with only the 7 train, or the IRT Flushing Line, serving the community, a light rail would attract more tourists. An easier way to get around will attract more people to at least go visit the community. However, from my visits of Flushing, the community can get very crowded at times. Perhaps some traffic calming can be introduced, as well as a way to discourage automobile use. This way, buses can get to their stops faster, and if there is space for either a bus rapid transit or a light rail, more people will be encourgaed to take that to get wherever they go. As someone who has had to go to Flushing on more than one occasion, the myriad of local buses would benefit from a central system to easily guide locals and tourists around.
        </div>

        <div class="text">Clearly, to introduce the measures Boston has taken to ensure accessibility and light rail supremacy in New York, a lot of steps will have to be taken. Most likely, the BQX will not pass just because of its association with de Blasio, who will leave office next year. The bickering of some New Jersey lawmakers will impede on any progress that might be made. Although projects like traffic congestion pricing and improved railroads have the blessing of President Joe Biden, locals are divided. Not only that; New York's existing infrastructure makes it incredibly difficult to introduce any kind of light-rail system. A fundamental change in how New York thinks, builds, and operates will be needed if it wishes to be anything like Boston.

        <div class="break_1">
            <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="text">New York City does not have a light rail system, however there is a Hudson-Bergen Light Rail that connects towns across the Hudson (Hoboken, Jersey City, Newport), and it has shown success. Current plans to build a Brooklyn-Queens Connector may be put under because of its connection with Bill de Blasio, as well as the many problems that prevent light rail from running smoothly in the city.</div>
        <div class="text">If New York were to build a light rail, a massive overhaul of how the city thinks will be needed. Currently, New York is not as accessible as many think it is. In addition, there is a lot of traffic, especially around Manhattan. Thanks to President Biden, there may be a way to charge for traffic congestion.</div>
