        <div class="text">According to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority website¹, 1631 marked the first chartered transit service in the United States as a ferry ran between the Shawmut Peninsula (North End) and Charlestown. Without the ferry, it took 2 days to each the peninsula from Chelsea. This ferry is still active today, making stops at the Airport, Hull, Charlestown, and Hingham.</div>

        <div class="text">Though the city was small, it was still appreciated to have a form of transportation. The Omnibus of the 1800s made multiple stops on already-established routes. Eventually, horse-drawn carriages would be seen around the city in spades. More than 20 companies had services! However, this proved problematic when the horses were in sick health, the roads were rough, the weather was cold, etc. The city began to research cable cars, looking toward cities like Los Angeles. Eventually, the city looked into Richmond's Union Passenger Railway. This railway became the prototype, according to the Engineering and Technology History Wiki², for electric street railways. Below is a picture of a streetcar from Richmond.</div>

        <div class="img"><img src="https://ethw.org/w/images/1/1a/Richmond_Union_Passenger_Railway.jpg"></div>

        <div class="text">The system, invented by Frank Sprague, ran on electric motors that utilized electrified copper wires overhead. In addition, Sprague created a three-point wheelbarrow syspension of axle-mounted geared motors, which was also used in light rails. Boston's city council was so impressed with this system that they built a line for Boston's first electric streetcar in 1889. This line is still utilized by the Green Line's C Branch today; it is known as the Cleveland Circle line. Below are images of Sprague's motor, as well as stops along the C Branch.</div>

        <div class="text">To ease crowding in Tremont Street, the Boston Elevated Railway Company (BERy), which eventually got absorbed into the MBTA, created the "articulated cars" in which two or more cars were semi-permanently joined to each other; they also opened the Tremont Street tunnel, which contained Boylston, Park Street, and Government Center. This became America's first subway tunnel.</div>

        <div class="text">In 1947, BERy got absorbed by the Metropolitan Transit Authority (no, not New York's. Boston's.) and expanded the subway to the Newton Highlands, which today is known as the Green Line's D Branch. Eventually, the myriads of railroad and transit companies in Greater Boston were joined into one system: The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), also known as the T. It became the first combined regional transportation system in the United States, debuting on August 3, 1964.</div>

        <div class="text">In 1965, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) provided funding for the modernization of stations such as Copley, Maverick, JFK/UMass, Kenmore, and Haymarket. In addition, the New Haven Railroad's lines were converted into the MBTA's Commuter Rail. Today, public transportation is seen as an essential form of transportation, especially after the gas shortages of the 70s, concern over air quality, and urban congestion. The MBTA is also one of the largest public transportation systems in the country, serving the Greater Boston area with ferries, railroads, heavy rail, light rail, buses, etc.</div>

        <div class="text">When it was first created, Boston was nothing more than a simple trade port. However, during the 1800s, it grew rapidly. Naturally, trade was a huge factor, but technological advancements helped bolster the transfer of ideas, creations, new goods, etc. Downtown Boston's street-planning is partly based on the location of colonial houses. Outside, suburban Boston took on a grid-like approach as the city expanded. </div>

        <div class="text">Expansion was halted when the Great Fire of 1872 ravaged the downtown area. The fire started in a warehouse in Summer Street, and devoured the financial district as well as 776 other buildings. Only thirteen people died, but the financial losses were plenty: $73.5 million (which translated today to $1.436 billion). After twelve hours, the fire was finally contained at Washington and Milk Streets. However, as the picture below suggests, the losses were devastating.</div>

        <div class="text">During that era, Boston did see a lot of growth, especially because of the construction of the subway. Suburban towns became integrated to Greater Boston, a park system was created to protect parks like the Boston Common and Fenway. The City Beautiful Movement sought to use government power to turn city-planning projects into a reality, and a planning board was created in 1914.</div>

        <div class="text">Like most cities, Boston suffered greatly during the Great Depression and the suburban flight of the 50s. Highways were built to accomodate the automobile movement. Also like most cities, the 80s was filled with crime. However, Boston underwent a huge turnaround for the better. The Hynes Convention Center was built, the Big Dig (which rerouted the Central Artery of Interstate-93 into the Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Tunnel) started construction, and the Harbor Point Apartments was established from a deteriorating Columbia Point. Today, the MBTA plans on renovating the Green Line, adding new security measures, installing new cars, and revamping a few stations.</div>

        <div class="text">Boston created the first subway system in the United States with the Tremont Street portal. Several lines are based off of older tracks (Cleveland Branch based on the first electric streetcar line, Newton Highlands based on Boston and Albany Railroad, Commuter Line based on New Haven Railroad). The MBTA was created to consolidate the myriad of railroad companies in the area, and is one of the largest public transportation systems in the United States.</div>

        <div class="text">Boston's downtown area is based on the placement of colonial houses and other important buildings. Outside (I.E. Fenway, Newton, Harvard), the city goes by a grid system. Like any other city, Boston suffered during the 1930s, 1950s, and 1980s. However, today several projects seek to transform the city, primarily the Big Dig and the Green Line Transformation. The Great Fire of 1872 disrupted the downtown community, and wrecked the financial district. However, the city healed.</div>
