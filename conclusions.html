        <div class="text">As seen in the beginning, Boston is considered America's first subway. Thus, one can look to them as the "blueprint" for future systems in the States. And, truly, it was! Boston created the first subway system in the United States with the Tremont Street portal. Several lines today are based off older tracks; for example, the Newton Branch of the Green Line utilizes tracks from the Highland branch of old commuter rails that were falling into disarray. Boston has shown that light rails can not only survive, but thrive in the era of automobiles. In fact, Boston has shown that trains and cars can co-exist; several of today's stations are park-and-ride, one of the biggest being the Red Line's Quincy Adams station. Going back to antiquities, Boston (and by extension, Milton) has shown with the Mattapan trolley that "heritage" can be not only operational, but essential; today's cars are historic streetcars that have a special team for repairs.</div>

        <div class="subheader">My Recommendations</div>
        <div class="break_1">
            <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="text">In terms of the city itself, it is essential that the light rail must be frequenrly maintained. There is a Green Line Transformation project that will address several issues, including signal problems, station accessibility, safety, etc. My recommendation is that, even though Boston is the ceremonial "blueprint" for the American transportation system, it would be great if the city took inspiration from cities like Seattle and Singapore. Seattle's influence is obvious; fully accessible buses and eco-friendly engines. Besides, Boston is on its way to becoming fully accessible, even more than New York City. However, the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit is considered one of the most comprehensive automated subway system in the world.</div>
        <div class="text">They utilize an automatic train control system that has two components: the automatic train operation (ATO) and automatic train protection (ATP). The ATO controls the cars, adjusting speed as they enter stations and opens both train doors and screen doors (installed in many Asian metro systems including Tokyo). The ATP communicates with the tracks, monitoring both the speed of the train and proximity to other trains. It also governs the emergency brakes.</div>
        <div class="text">I think Boston can implement certain aspects of this system to better ensure safety, especially along the Green Line. That line is most suspect to accidents due to its varying rights-of-way. In the city center, it has complete right of way due to being underground; near universities, it has a dedicated lane on streets; however, in the suburbs, there is no lane and it runs alongside automobiles. An automated security system (which is part of the Transformation project) would help make the line safer for all.</div>

        <div class="subheader">Lessons for New York</div>
        <div class="break_1">
            <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="text">It seems that New York has a lot of catching up to do if it wants to be on Boston's level. In the past, there were plenty of light rails, but they have been discarded in favor of buses and subways. Of course, they are the more efficient method of transportation; however, today's riders think the system is terrible. Delays, signal problems, a lack of cleanliness, inadequare funding, etc. In addition, as stated before, only 24% of MTA subway stations are ADA accessible. There are plans to make more stations accessible, but currently, the system is not on track to become fully accessible.</div>
        <div class="text">The applications page contains my thoughts on what New York could do to improve its situation. Frankly, a complete overhaul of how the city thinks will be needed it significant progress will be made. There are plans for a Brooklyn-Queens Connector, but due to its inherent connection with current NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio, its future is in question. And even if the BQX goes ahead, many adjustments will have to be made to streets to accomodate light rail traffic. The places that would benefit from light rail (I.E. Flushing) often have a myriad of bus routes and high density congestion. Overall, it will be very difficult to implement light rail in New York City effectively, and again, an overhaul of New York's systems and way of thinking will be needed if they are ever to go ahead with light rail.</div>

        <div class="subheader">Sustainable Transportation</div>
        <div class="break_1">
            <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="text">As stated before, sustainable transportation has become a huge issue in today's world. The European Union Council of Ministers of Transport defines sustainable transportation as a system that "limits emissions and waste within the planet's ability to absorb them, uses renewable resources at or below their rates of generation, and uses non-renewable resources at or below the rates of development of renewable substitutes, while minimizing the impact on the use of land and the generation of noise." Of course, there are other aspects to sustainable transportation, as previosuly discussed in class. Affordability, accessibility, and efficiency also fits in the sustainable transport bubble.</div>

        <div class="text">According to the EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency), in terms of goals to achieve sustainable transportation, "many long-range transportation plans begin with adopting a vision. A vision statement articulates a region’s aspirations for the transportation system in a few sentences or paragraphs." The goal of the Green Line Transformation is to modernize the system and "improve reliability and the overall quality of service for all riders and communities served by the Green Line." Currently, many projects are still in progress, but there are some completed goals, including new trains and major track improvements. The project is a five-year capital investment plan that started in 2018; thus, it is slated to be completed in 2023. Significant progress is being made to fulfill the MBTA's vision for the future in terms of sustainable transportation. Apart from already being a moderately sustainable system in the United States (especially when compared to New York), it is making strides to push its boundaries, which is commendable.</div>

        <div class="text">Also according to the EPA, "Corridor or sub-area studies provide opportunities for more focused and detailed consideration of sustainability measures and strategies. At the corridor level, accessibility performance measures become more specific, and the consideration of multimodal options can be refined." In terms of testing the MBTA for how resilient it will be in the face of climate change, each and every individual line is being tested - or is due to be tested. The only progress that has been made according to the MBTA is with the Blue Line, which of course is one of the most vulnerable due to its closeness to the Atlantic Ocean via Revere Beach and Wonderland. However, the fact that Boston is taking measures to improve their transportation system in the wake of disasters like Hurricane Sandy, which ravaged the New York subway system to the point where old lines had to be brought back (I.E. the H train to the Rockaways, the old South Ferry station being used when the new one completely flooded), is huge, especially for a major US city. From my research done on the city's transportation, the future looks bright. Even if not much progress will be done in the long run, especially due to COVID, Boston is in a better place than New York in terms of public transportation. It's already sustainable, and seeks to improve and expand on that; it's no wonder Boston is considered among the best cities for public transportation in the United States.</div>
