        <div class="text">Within the past decade, sustainable transportation has been a major concern, especially with the threat of climate change looming. Ever since the Industrial Revolutions of the 19th century spurred innovation and facility, society has reaped the benefits and progressed further. However, the often-ignored consequences of such innovations (often powered by coal or other such fuels) have done much to the Earth’s constitution. And it appears that now, Mother Nature has come to collect. </div>

        <div class="img"></div>

        <div class="text">Thankfully, it seems as if the world is waking up to this call and acting accordingly. The Paris Agreement drafted by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change urges nations to reduce emissions as much as possible in an effort to slow the increase in global average temperatures. Thankfully, when it comes to rails, they emit 76% less in greenhouse gases than an average single-occupancy vehicle. Speaking of, rails are a form of mass-transit that involves a collection of cars that run over tracks. The light rail, specifically, operates as a tram / streetcar and utilizes exclusive right-of-way to navigate the city streets. According to Wikipedia, Boston is the 4th largest city in terms of light rail ridership; Los Angeles is 1st.</div>

        <div class="text">The light rail has had quite the renaissance in the turn of the 21st century. With cities gaining a sort-of resurgence in population, newer ways to move people had to be made. Or, in this case, brought back. Cities like Newark, Jersey City, Dallas, and Portland created light rail systems (the Newark Light Rail, the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail, the DART Light Rail, and the MAX Light Rail) that connected neighborhoods and operated alongside traffic. To this day, these systems are still in place, though their current state varies. Some, like the Hudson-Bergen light rail, are small yet they do their job perfectly! Others are too small.

        <div class="text">This website will detail how metro systems, particularly the oldest system in America, have persevered and diversified without sacrificing city infrastructure. To clarify, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority and its subway lines in Boston will be reviewed. Regarded as the oldest subway system in the United States, it was built in 1897 as the culmination of the invention of the electric motor in 1886. What really stands out about Boston’s subway system is how heavily diversified it is. The MBTA itself consists of four subway lines, three of them heavy rail (Red, Yellow, Blue) and one of which is light-rail (Green). Shown below is the map of the MBTA.</div>

        <div class="img"><img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2Fd%2Fdb%2F2013_unofficial_MBTA_subway_map_by_Michael_Kvrivishvili.png%2F1200px-2013_unofficial_MBTA_subway_map_by_Michael_Kvrivishvili.png&f=1&nofb=1"></a></div>


        <div class="text">The key innovation, as stated, is the MBTA’s perseverance amidst a changing world. Ever since the birth of the suburbs, rapid transit, especially the light rail, has seen decreases in service and subsidies, to the point where some cities like Los Angeles abandoned light-rails. Regarding the United States, ever since the advent of the automobile and suburban America, light-rail services have been discontinued across cities according to Herbert S. Levinson, John G. Allen, & William F. Hoey in their article Light Rail Since World War II: Abandonments, Survivals, and Revivals. Today, only a handful of cities still use light-rails, like San Francisco, Seattle, and Philadelphia. However, Boston’s Green Line has not only survived, but it also thrived, and is due for expansion within the decade.</div>

        <div class="text">Before one dives too much into the specifics of Boston’s rapid transit system, one must talk about the history and geography of Boston.</div>

        <div class="text">Boston is known as the birth of the American Revolution. Formed in 1630, it was the capital of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and it specialized in trade, being formed in a natural harbor. It was in Boston where the Massacre and Tea Party took place, helping to kickstart the Revolution. It also saw numerous skirmishes; for example, the Battle of Bunker Hill in 1775.
        </div>

        <div class="text">Boston has a population of 695,506, though the Greater Boston area (which includes the suburbs of Cambridge, Lexington, Waltham, and Burlington) houses approximately 4.7 million. According to BestPlaces.com, the average income of a Boston resident is $34,770 a year, with the median household income being $54,485 a year. Lying on the Charles and Mystic Rivers, Boston is a natural harbor, and thus has direct access to the Atlantic Ocean. According to City-Data.com, Boston is one of the wettest cities in America, with frequent snow and rain throughout the year. Because of its proximity to the ocean and how far from the equator it is, Boston is prone to numerous nor’easters and snowstorms, as well as drifts from the ocean. The annual average temperature is 51.6° F. Which is cold.</div>

        <div class="text">Thus it would make sense for there to be at least a subway system in Boston. It is generally much warmer underground, and the downtown area is small, but quite packed. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers Website, the city’s main streets were “regularly subject to gridlock from a convergence of foot traffic, horse-drawn conveyances, trolley lines, and electric streetcars.”

        <div class="text">Sustainable transportation has grown increasingly important and vital to the world we now find ourselves in. Of course, it is very multifaceted.</div>
        <div class="text">Boston is regarded as the oldest subway in America, and thus has a hidden role as the "blueprint" for future subways to look at and use as a reference. This is especially true when it comes to light rail, with the Green Line due for expansion and renovation this decade.</div>
