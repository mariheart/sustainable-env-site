        <div class="break_1">
            <hr>
        </div>
        <div class="text">The MBTA and Philadelphia's SEPTA are the only transportation authorities in the United States that employs all five modes of public transport: light rail, heavy rail, commuter rail, trolleybuses, and motor buses. The MBTA is the most expansive of the two, reaching out to various suburbs in the Massachusetts Bay area. The MBTA's Commuter Rail reached out toward a third of Massachusetts.</div>

        <div class="text">A partciular example in which the MBTA has seen success is on the Green Line's Riverside branch. John G. Allen's Inner Zone Commuter Rail as an Opportunity for Light Rail details the history of the branch, and how it persisted for so long. At one point, the branch was on the verge of collapse; since it "was poorly served and poorly patronized, even though it ran entirely on a grade-separated alignment serving the prosperous suburbs of Brookline and Newton in a busy travel corridor" (Allen 42). It was immensely utilized before the Great Depression; however, afterward the railroads that ran across this branch were begging to abandon it. In an effort to save the Riverside branch (then known as the Highland Branch), plans were made to convert it into an electric rail line. Since the 1920s, this plan was up in the air; however, it came to fruition in the 1950s. This is because of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority's decision to "extend its toll expressway from Route 128 near Riverside all the way into downtown Boston" (Allen 42). Note that during the 1950s, when those who could afford it moved away to suburbs, it was thought that cars were king; it is why streetcars were on the decline in many American cities like Los Angeles. Normally, most local governments would immediately abandon the Highland Branch and convert it for automobile use. However, the Bostonian government thought differently. They decided that this "strategically-located line  was too important to die" (Allen 42). The line was bought out and repurposed as a light rail line, and to this day, still stands as one of the Green Line's integral branches.

        <div class="text">Converting the Riverside branch into a light rail line cost the MBTA very little, as the project itself was completed ahead of schedule and under budget. The outcome was spectacular; ridership exceeded expectations, and the light rail was shown to be able to compete with the automobile. It has also shown that automobiles and rapid transit can complement each other! Boston has many park-and-ride locations throughout the area; a famous one is the Quincy Adams station on the Red Line. Much of the station is, in fact, a parking lot with enough space for about 2500 cars!

        <div class="text">One more example of a successful investment is the Ashmont-Mattapan High Speed Line. Officially designated as an extension of the Red Line, it is a light-rail branch that serves as the bridge between Boston and Milton. On the surface, it looks just like a heritage streetcar, not unlike the vintage trains one might encounter on the MTA from time to time. However, it serves an integral part of commuters, especially those from Milton, a niehgboring town. In fact, any proposal to rejuvenate the line by adding new rolling stock has been met with criticism. Just like the Riverside Branch, it used to be a commuter rail line. All of its stations, except Valley Road, are fully accessible.</div>

        <div class="break_1">
            <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="text">Just like any other project, COVID has put a huge damper on several of the MBTA's projects. For example, station improvements and extending the Green Line had to be put on hold while the pandemic raged across the world. Today, a few of these projects are back under construction, but the pandemic has still delayed most by at least a few months.
        </div>

        <div class="img"><img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Falchetron.com%2Fcdn%2Flechmere-mbta-station-472d84e6-7e12-48da-93d9-e37f65f0c15-resize-750.jpg&f=1&nofb=1"></div>

        <div class="text">However, given Boston's location, one cannot deny the impact that climate change will have on the city, and how the MBTA needs to prepare for that. Most at risk are the light rails, such as the Green Line and the Mattapan trolley, since they are street-level cars and the tracks are not protected against the snow and hail. While, according to the MBTA's website, they have equipped heaters along the Red and Orange lines (all heavy-rail lines), not all lines are given this much protection. The Blue line, a heavy-rail line, runs mostly above ground, and runs near waterfronts, which puts the line at risk of heavy winds and snow. Given the current trend of extreme weather (one need only look at New York when Hurricane Sandy hit in 2012), it will be imperative for the MBTA to prepare for the absolute worst. Nor'easters that can wipe out power grids, frequent snowstorms, extreme temperatures. Boston is a very northern city (in more ways than one), and so as the blueprint for ground transportation, it must lead the charge in addressing climare disaster and how transportation authorities should prepare and respond.
        </div>

        <div class="text">The MBTA has recognized this threat and are making moves to address climate change and its impact on Boston's systems. According to their site, they are aiming to "meet[s] the needs of the 21st century, help[s] get people out of their cars, and support[s] good land use in Greater Boston." Currently, they are assessing each mode of transportation and their vulnerability to natural disasters. Along the Blue Line, assessment has been completed, especially in vulnerable stations like Orient Heights and Aquarium. The Orange and Red Lines are still in progress, but the Green Line has not been started yet, which is strange considering it is one of the most vulnerable. Still, efforts have been made to prepare the city for disaster.
       </div>

       <div class="text">The Fenway Portal Flood Protection Project, which has been completed, has installed flood doors along the Green Line D branch. Flood doors will also be installed along the Blue Line, particularly in Aquarium. Near the Charleston Garage, sea walls are being built and reinforced to protect from sea level rise and erosion.

        <div class="text">As stated before, Philadelphia's SEPTA is the only other transit system in the US that employs the light rail, heavy rail, commuter rail, motor buses, and trolleybuses. Also known as the Southern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, it serves not only Philadelphia, but also the neighboring states of New Jersey and Delaware via its commuter rail. However, unlike Boston, it seems to have faced quite a few challenges during its almost 60-year span; its workers have very frequently gone on strikes, the most recent being in 2016.

        <div class="text">In terms of accessibility, Seattle has become one of the US' best cities for public transportation. Its bus transit is fully accessible, according to Jason Notte on Cheapism's article, "The Least and Most Wheelchair-Friendly Cities for Public Transportation". In addition, its Sound Transit features an accessible light rail, commuter rail, and double decker buses. In addition to being disability-friendly, the Sound Transit is also eco-friendly, utilizing wind electricity and borrowing Seattle City Light's fully carbon-neutral power supply.

        <div class="text">The MBTA has produced successful results when it comes to innovations in public transportation, like the park-and-ride system and the use of "heritage" cars and lines. More success is on the way, though COVID has put a bit of a damper in the process.</div>
        <div class="text">Philadelphia's SEPTA is similar to Boston in that it combines light rail, heavy rail, commuter rail, trolleybsues, and motor buses. However, it struggles with its workers going on strikes, management problems, etc. Seattle, however, seems to surpass Boston when it comes to accessibility, with a fully-accessible bus system, eco-friendly methods, and rapid progress in making the entire system disability-friendly.</div>
